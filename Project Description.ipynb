It also shows a severity type and the collision type of the accident which provides a detailed description of the type of accident and the conditions it occured in.\n\nThe solution will be to generate a predictor with the SEVERITYCODE as the target variable. It will be able to measure and proedict the severity of an accident based on a scale of 0-5. The attributes used will be 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'. The scale is described as below:\n\n   a) 0: Little to No Probability (Clear Weather Conditions)\n   b) 1: Very Low Probabibility (Chance of Property Damage)\n   c) 2: Low Probability (Chance of Injury)\n   d) 4: High Probability (Chance of Fatality)"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
